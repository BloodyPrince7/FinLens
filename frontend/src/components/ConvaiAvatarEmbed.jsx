/**
 * Attempts to show Convai's official financial advisor via its public Share Link
 * (https://x.convai.com/experience/{id}), without the paid Pixel Streaming
 * Embed product this account's free plan doesn't support.
 *
 * Verified technical facts behind this component (not assumptions):
 * - The Share Link page sends `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *`
 *   and `X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL` - framing it from any origin, including
 *   localhost, is NOT blocked by browser security. No CORS/CSP workaround
 *   needed or attempted here.
 * - BUT the page's own content requires the *viewer* to be logged into a
 *   Convai account - confirmed with curl (zero cookies, zero referrer):
 *   it renders "Experience Not Found" regardless of origin. This is a
 *   content-level auth gate on Convai's side, not a framing restriction,
 *   and it cannot be detected from our JS: the iframe is cross-origin, so
 *   `iframe.contentDocument` is blocked by the browser and we can't read
 *   what it actually rendered.
 *
 * Practical effect: if you personally are signed into Convai in the same
 * browser you're viewing this site with, the embed below may show the real
 * avatar (your session cookie carries over). Anyone else - including real
 * end users - will see Convai's own "Experience Not Found" screen instead.
 * That's why the "Open FinLens Advisor" button (guaranteed to work, since
 * it's a plain top-level navigation) is always shown alongside it, not
 * hidden behind a success/failure check we can't actually perform.
 *
 * To upgrade later: once domain whitelisting is available (paid plan),
 * replace the iframe with `@convai/experience-embed`'s `PixelStreamComponent`.
